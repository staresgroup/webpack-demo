# webpack demo

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

### Local Installation

install webpack:

``` bash
npm install --save-dev webpack
# or specific version
npm install --save-dev webpack@<version>
```

install webpack-cli:

``` bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-cli
```

### Global Installation

> ote that this is **not a recommended practice**. Installing globally locks you down to a specific version of webpack and could fail in projects that use a different version.

install webpack:


``` bash
npm install --global webpack
```

install webpack-cli:

```bash
npm install --global webpack-cli
```
